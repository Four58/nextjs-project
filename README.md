# nextjs-project
This is a nextjs project I learned from Udemy. 
In this project, I created a meetup website where people can post the image using image address and adding some detail about it. 
The user can also delete the post (The instructor does not teach this, but I learn it myself)

The meetup posts that show up on the browser will be fetched from my MongoDB Atlas. Which it could take sometimes to load some information.
You can replace my MongoDB with yours. 
When the user add new meetups post, the data will be sent to MongoDB. And when the user delete it, the data will be deleted in MongoDB. 

P.S. CSS files are provided by my instructor and I only edited some of it.
